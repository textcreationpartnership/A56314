            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap> be true which <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12: 12, <hi>Of making many books there is no end, and much ſtudy is a wearineſs to the fleſh:</hi> Yet I hope none can juſtly blame me for publiſhing this, when they ſeriouſly conſider, that the drift of it is only to clear the truth and thoſe many good men groſſly as perſed, from the envious inſinuations caſt againſt it and them, and the wrong inferences pretendedly drawn from their writings by our preſent Adverſary <hi>Daniel Leeds,</hi> who has, hand over head, in a very palpable manner, to his own ſhame, ventured to abuſe our friends at a very ſhamefull rate; not only by wrong meanings put upon their words and doctrines, but alſo by falſe Citations out of their books, thereby endeavouring to make them ſpeak, what they never ſpake, nor (I beleive) ever thought; in order to repreſent them to the people greatly contradictory to one another. Of which falſe Citations I ſhall in this place produce one, and but one, referring thee to the following book for a view of many more of them; It is in <hi>Number</hi> 58, where he quotes <hi>William Penn</hi> his <hi>Sandy Foundation</hi> p 20, ſaying; <hi>W. P. there calls the man Chriſt, The finite impotent Creature:</hi> Whereas there is no ſuch ſaying or irreverent expreſſion in the whole book: for where <hi>W. P.</hi> uſes the words. <hi>Finite and impotent Creature,</hi> The ſubject he was there treating of plainly ſhews, that he meant it of us ſinners that need forgiveneſs; but not of the Man Chriſt who never ſinned. Than which, what greater abuſe could be put upon any mans writings?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reader,</hi> The ſubſtance of this book was wrote near two years ago, but being backward in my ſelf to appear in print, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> alſo the preſs being long expected here before it came, and when come taken up with other important matters interve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, occaſioned the delay of its publication till now.</p>
            <p>As for the Errours of the preſs, which are many, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the former part of the book; and more eſpecially in one place, which is very material to be corrected, without which it will read ſo, as will make it look very groſs, and appear to
<pb facs="tcp:45026:3"/>
be falſe doctrine; it is in p. 17: l. 9, where after, <hi>works ſake</hi> the Printer hath omitted, <hi>but for his ſake,</hi> which words are in the written copy by which he printed it. I muſt deſire thee <hi>(Reader)</hi> upon occaſion to take the trouble of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>urning to the <hi>Errata,</hi> where I hope thou wilt find the moſt material collected. The chief occaſion of there being ſo many errours, was, the Printer being a man of another nation and language, as alſo not bred to that employment, conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſomething unexpert both in language and calling, and the corrector's not being ſo frequently at hand as the caſe required, all which I deſire thou wouldſt favourably conſider.</p>
            <p>The Intent of publiſhing this, was chiefly to prevent any from being deceived, and alſo to undeceive thoſe that may have been already deceived by this unfair, man's abuſive book; for ſuch it is, and as ſuch, let it be added to the Catalogue of thoſe many envious and abuſive writings, that have been ſent forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, from time to time, to hinder the ſpreading of truth, and the progreſs of Gods people in the way of it: all which will ſurely be accounted for one day, and not witſtanding all which, the truth remains the ſame, and I am ſatisfied will more and more ſpread it ſelf, and prevail, in and upon and the hearts ſpirits of people, notwithſtanding the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and reſtleſs attempts of its Oppoſers, to hinder it. And as the way of its working, is to cleanſe and purify mankind in ſoul, body and ſpirit, and make them fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> temples for God to dwell in, by virtue of his holyſpirit in us and alſo entitle us effectually, to partake of the great and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable benefit, that accrues to mankind, by that one offering of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, on the tree of the Croſs: So it is highly neceſſary that we more and more come to experience this cleanſing work to be wrought in us, in order to be entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to thoſe afore ſaid benefits. For although our bleſſed Lord Jeſus Chriſt then offered up himſelf for the ſins of the whole world, yet we read of none, wbo <hi>by that offering are for ever perfected,</hi> but <hi>thoſe who are ſanctified.</hi> Heb. 10: 14.</p>

            <p>Before I come to the <hi>Book</hi> it ſelf, I ſhall touch a little upon the <hi>Preface,</hi> and begin with an expreſſion of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel Leeds's,</hi> which runs thus. <q>It is my real belief, That the <hi>Quakers</hi> at firſt came forth in life and power, and made a good beginning.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Anſwer. Did they ſo? How comes it then to paſs, that the firſt Inſtruments of that good beginning in life and power, as <hi>G. Fox, G. Whitehead, E. Bourough, R. Hubberthorn, Is. Pennington &amp;c.</hi> and their antient works and Writings, muſt be thus brought upon the ſtage, by this <hi>Daniel Leeds</hi> himſelf, even in this very book, endeavouring thereby to prove their doctrine falſe, inconſiſtent, and little leſs than a meer heap of confuſion? Can ſuch things be an effect of <hi>life and power?</hi> And if he ſay, They loſt that <hi>life and powr</hi> again, before thoſe books were written: It may then be obſerved, how in the ſame Page he inſinuates, <q>as if the loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of it again, was through their contending with one another about trifles and Ceremonies,</q> inſtituting this and that order, and getting into form &amp;c. Whereas it is well known, that many of the above named Friends Books were written before the <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of thoſe <hi>Orders,</hi> (as he calls them). Beſides, I find in a Paper entitulad <hi>A breif Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp;c.</hi> (delivered to Friends here at the yearly meeting in the year 1696. Which as I am credibly informed) was written by <hi>Daniel Leeds,</hi> there being alſo the two letters of his name, with two letters more ſubſchribed to it) after having expreſſed what an healthy flouriſhing Country this was about eight years before, this paſſage, viz Doubtleſs it might have ſo continued, if the kernell of life and love had not took wing &amp;c. Now hence I obſerve, That (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this aknoledgement (for ſuch it is implicitely at

Moreover if <hi>the life and love took Wings,</hi> but about or ſince the jear 1688, how could thoſe <hi>Orders</hi> which were eſtabliſhed above twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years before be the occaſion of it? Again, what Orders have We that they diſown? Have We Montly meetings? So have they. Have We Yearly meetings? So have they? Have We Womens meetings? <hi>Daniel Leeds</hi> ſaith, <q>Thoſe Meetings are certainly of ſervice in Deeds of Charity and Hoſpitality, page 66.</q>

               <hi>Quakers,</hi> and that of a primitive ſtamp too, would have forſaken him, and his notions alſo. Well, then he finds out a way to gloſs over this place, and would have us believe, That when he denyed, as aforeſaid, the knowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the outward to be univerſally neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, his meaning was, that it was not ſo neceſſary to ſalvation begun; as if that difference betwixt our Friends, whom <hi>G.

Now theſe things put me into a farther ſearch, into both his former and latter books, and in his former I ſtill found, where he was concerned to treat of the ſubject, he alvvais denyed that knovvledge to be eſſentially neceſſary to ſalvation, particularly in his <hi>Univerſal free Grace &amp;c., p.</hi> 117, and <hi>Light of truth triumphant, p.</hi> 6. By his former books, I mean ſuch as bear date before the year. 1681. or thereabouts, Which is ſuppoſed to be about the time that he wrote (as he acknowledged) 199 of the 200 queries concerning the <hi>Revolution of humane ſouls &amp;c.</hi> But by his latter books it appears, that he is clearly changed in principle as to the point of doctrine; and I finding things thus, and alſo how he was receded from his principles in ſome other matters, wherein he differed with Friends, as About the ſufficiency of the Light without ſomething elſe, and about Preachers being Magiſtrares, and of the confuſed work he had made about his ſtrange notions of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, as in my ſaid book is ſhovvn: This I ſay, Was the occaſion of my Writing that book, that thereby I might ſhevv to them, eſpecially to the moſt ſincere amongſt them, hovv he vvent about to deceive them, by drilling them on, and perſvvading them, <hi>we could never prove, he was chaing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Principles,</hi> as his ovvn vvords are, ſee, <hi>Some Fundamental Truths p:</hi> 13.

of my preſent doctrine with all [mark all] my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and latter books.</q> Behold now the man; for if this be true, what need he now at a pinch have put out his book of <hi>Retraetations:</hi> why he was driven to it, he muſt either do it, or elſe ſome of his followers might have fallen out with him about it; for ſome of them were not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with him in that reſpect; Nay, if we can beleive this D.

But there is one thing more, which I am ſure he ought not only to Retract, now his hand is in, but alſe deeply to lament, and that is; His ſo abuſing his poor bigotted followers Cas I have already hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) in his thus deluding them, by ſo often perſwading them, at the firſt, that he was not changed in his Principles; and when he hath done this, I know not, but as to this point, he may pretty well paſs, for ſuch a kind of an honeſt man, as is ſo vvith good looking to: But before he dos thus much, I do not ſee hovv he can be afforded the appellation. And novv to conclude, I do ſay; that ſuppoſe I had ſeen, and took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of ſome paſſages in our Friends books, which might ſeem to me like inconſiſtencys, eſpecially in relation to things not then in controverſy, I do not look upon my ſelf equally obliged to expoſe them, as I did his, which were ſo palpable, and done for the reaſon aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>The next thing I ſhall take noice of, is, <hi>Daniel Leeds s'</hi> pretences in this his <hi>Preface</hi> now be fore me; that <q>His pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, here in to expoſe and publiſh what follows [in his book] was by amotion heavenly.</q> Yet I queſtion not to prove him in his thus doing not only an <hi>Accuſer,</hi> but a very falſe <hi>Accuſer of the Brethren;</hi> which to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

yet if his meaning he ſuch, it will by no means deſerve the credit, that was given to his Idle prediction, publiſhed in his Almanack for the jear 1695, where he ſaith; <q>All lovers of truth are to take notie, that from and after the 25. of <hi>January,</hi> no perſon ſhall find it ſafer ſhrouding under the name and denomination of a <hi>Quaker,</hi> than under the name of any other profeſſion of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> what ſoever &amp;c.</q> For we have all along known, that no perſon not only from and after the month he calls <hi>January,</hi> but at no time elſe, hath been; is, or will be any thing the ſafer, for their being under the denomination of a <hi>Quaker,</hi> any more than that <hi>D.

            <p>I come now to his quotations out of our Friends books, which he has placed in two columns, under the notion of contradictions, which, how far he proves them ſo to be, or how far he falls ſhort of proof, as alſo how honeſtly or how diſhoneſtly he deals with them, will appear in the following examination of them (or at leaſt of ſo many of them as may give the Reader a ſufficient taſt of the reſt; I not having all the friends books quoted on both ſides by me) and my remarks thereon, by way of anſwer thereunto.</p>

            <p>His next flingh is grounded cheifly upon his abuſing <hi>G: W</hi>'s. words and meaning, as well as that he there in abuſeth his Reader, by his forging words in <hi>G.

            <p>In the ſame 14th. page he cites W. <hi>P's Rejoinder</hi> p: 287,

thus, <q>No preſent work, how good ſoever, can juſtifie any man from the condemnation which is due for the guilt of ſin, that is paſt;</q> To which he oppoſes <hi>Sandy Foundation</hi> p: 16, thus, <q>God's remiſſion is grounded on our repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Though <hi>W: P.</hi> ſaies in the one book, <hi>No preſent work how good ſoever, can juſtify any man from the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation which is due for the guilt of ſin that is paſt.</hi> Yet there is nothing in the other book, that (ſo much as conſequential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) doth ſay it can: For though it is there ſaid, <hi>That Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion is grounded on our repentance;</hi> yet yit is to be obſerved, that it is called <hi>Gods remiſſion,</hi> and ſo no preſent work how good ſoever, of ours can either remit or juſtifie us; for it is Gods remiſſion, and ſo called by W: <hi>P.</hi> And although W: P. ſaith, it is grounded upon our repentance, yet it is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in a ſcriptural ſence, and one of the ſcriptures which <hi>VV: P.</hi> brought to prove what he aſſerted was 2 Chr. 30<hi>:</hi> 9. <q>
                  <hi>For if ye turn again unto the Lord, the Lord your God is gracious and mercifull, and will not turn away his face from you.</hi>
               </q> Where (ſaith W<hi>: P.)</hi> how natural is it to obſerve that Gods remiſſion is grounded on their repentan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce; and not that it's impoſſible to pardon, without a plena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſatisfaction which was his then Antagoniſt's doctrine; and the ſeveral ſcriptures brought by W: <hi>P.</hi> prove clearly, that it was upon <hi>the wicked's returning again to the Lord, that he remitted them, had mercy on them, and abundantly pardonned them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again p. 15 he quotes <hi>G. F's. Catechiſm</hi> p: 2 <q>The light that ſhews to every man his evil deeds, is <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </q> In oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to which he produced <hi>W. P's Chriſtian Quaker</hi> p: 91 We do not ſay that the light in every man is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer:</hi> Tho G: F. ſaies, The light that ſhews to every man his evil deeds is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> yet <hi>W. P.</hi> ſaies nothing to the contrary, ſo no cnotradiction. And this is certainly true, that the great Light that ſhews to every man his evil deeds is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> according to <hi>G: F.,</hi> tho the meaſure that is contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45026:12"/>
in every man, <hi>W:</hi> P. chuſes here rather to call the light of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> than <hi>Chriſt</hi> in fulneſs. And G: K. himſelf in a late book entituled <hi>Hereſy and Hatred</hi> p: 14. ſay's <q>The light within being God and <hi>Chriſt;</hi>
               </q> and yet in the ſame page he calls it A real meaſure or the eternal word <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> No queſtion but this is ſound enough in G: K. though it would ſcarce be ſo in us.</p>
            <p>He adds a citation out of G: F's <hi>Great miſtery</hi> p<hi>:</hi> 185 viz <q>The Devil teacheth them, in whom he fows his ſeed, not to have the light within them, the ſeed <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Root of God.</q> Upon which <hi>D:</hi> L. notes, <q>Who muſt we believe, G: F. or G: W. and W: P.? For here G<hi>:</hi> F. holds the light within to be not only <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but even the <hi>Root of God.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> This is partly anſwered by the foregoing: And whereas G: F. calls the light, the ſeed <hi>Chriſt,</hi> it is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Scripture, which ſaies <hi>Chriſt is the Light of the world</hi> John 8: 12, and alſo it is ſaid <hi>Gal:</hi> 3<hi>:</hi> 16 that <hi>the Seed is Chriſt;</hi> and whereas G<hi>:</hi> F. ſaies ſo of the light within, it is no more than to ſay, and that in a ſcriptural ſence, <hi>Chriſt within the hope of glory Coll.</hi> 1<hi>:</hi> 27. and yet in <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4<hi>:</hi> 7. it is ſaid <hi>But unto every one of us is given grace according to the meaſure of the gift of Chriſt;</hi> and ſurely <hi>D: L.</hi> will not ſay this is a contradiction. Beſides, I remember that <hi>G: K.</hi> in a letter to <hi>John Delaval,</hi> which I have by me in <hi>G. K's</hi> hand writing, in the year 1692, ſaith; <q>To ſay the man <hi>Chriſt</hi> is in us, or the light in us is the man <hi>Chriſt,</hi> I do not contradict it in a true ſcripture ſence, as he is called <hi>the hidden man of the heart,</hi> and <hi>the new man,</hi> but this is a figurative expreſſion, and that in a twofold reſpect: Firſt by a Metaphor, or Allagory, as he is called <hi>a Lamb, a Lion.</hi> 2dly By <hi>a</hi> Sydechdoche of the giving the name of the whole to the meaſure.</q> Now I ſay, if <hi>G. K.</hi> be thus allowed to diſtinguiſh, why may not <hi>G: F., G: W.</hi> and <hi>VV: P.</hi> and as for <hi>G<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> F's.</hi> uſing this expreſſion <hi>The ROOT of God? I ask</hi> Doth not <hi>Paul</hi> alſo uſe this expreſſion? viz <hi>The Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of God?</hi> 2 Tim. 2: 19, and as <hi>Chriſt</hi> is Gods Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for us to build upon; ſo alſo he is according to <hi>Rom:</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:45026:13"/>
11: 16: 17: 18 the <hi>root</hi> for us to grow upon. And <hi>G: K.</hi> in his <hi>VVay caſt up</hi> p: 114 ſais, <q>That <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the Root and vine into which the Saints are grafted.</q>
            </p>
            <p>As to the next claſh, It is alſo partly anſwered by the foregoing; it relates to ſomething <hi>G: F.</hi> ſaid in anſwer to a Prieſt, who commonly in thoſe daies denyed God and <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be in men according to ſcripture: Though in this caſe, I do confeſs the Prieſt's words were true in a ſence, viz That whole <hi>Chriſt,</hi> God and Man is not in men; yet that God is in men is clear according to Scripture, and that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is in men is clear according to Scripture, and that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is in men, not only as he is God, but alſo as man, is clear according to <hi>D: L's.</hi> great Friend <hi>G. K.</hi> who in his <hi>VVay caſt up</hi> p. 123 ſaith <q>That <hi>Chriſt</hi> is really preſent in and among us, not only as he is God, but alſo as he is man.</q> Now ſince <hi>Chriſt</hi> as he is God dweller in us accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Scripture, and as he is man he dwelleth in us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>G<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> K.</hi> as he is God and man is he not the whole <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Yet that he doth ſo dwell in us, as that the whole fulneſs of the Godhead and manhood, is contained in men; I believe, neither <hi>G. F.</hi> nor <hi>G. K.</hi> did own, any more than <hi>W<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> P.</hi> Beſides, <hi>G. F.</hi> anſwer to the Prieſt was but by way of query, which does not alwaies conclude a judgement<hi>:</hi> For when <hi>Chriſt</hi> asked the Phariſees, <hi>what think ye of</hi> Chriſt? <hi>whoſe ſon is he? they ſaid unto him, The ſon of</hi> David; Chriſt anſwered by way of query, <hi>How then doth</hi> David <hi>in ſpirit call him Lord</hi> Matt. 22. 42: 43. Now by this his anſwer, <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not deny himſelf to be the Son of <hi>David;</hi> for that would have contradicted the ſcripture, which calls him the ſon of <hi>David</hi> &amp;c. Matt. 1: 1. And ſo <hi>G. F's.</hi> asking a queſtion, cannot be ſaid to be a denyal of <hi>W. P's.</hi> aſſertion, therefore no contradiction.</p>
            <p>I come now to his p: 17: 18, to what he cites from <hi>G. F</hi> about the ſoul. To which I ſay, 1ſt. It hath been often anſwered by our Friends, particularly <hi>G. W.</hi> and <hi>W. P.</hi> 2dly Though <hi>D. L.</hi> ſlights their anſwers, counting them fallacious &amp;c. Yet his peculiar Friend <hi>G. K.</hi> hath but in the year 1692
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45026:13"/>
vindicated, both <hi>G. F.</hi> doctrine about the ſoul, and alſo <hi>W. P's.</hi> anſwers to the Profeſſours, about the very ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of <hi>G. F.'s.,</hi> which <hi>D. L.</hi> cites; ſee his <hi>Serious appeal</hi> p: 60, not yet retracted, where it may be ſeen, that what <hi>D. L.</hi> calls in <hi>G. W.</hi> and <hi>W. P. Fallacious equivocation,</hi> his Friend <hi>G. K.</hi> calls <hi>a Sufficient vindication.</hi> Now what curious wire drawing will <hi>D, L.</hi> uſe here, to clear himſelf from contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting his great Friend <hi>G. K.</hi> But ſince among ſo many learned and Wiſe men, there have been ſo many opinions about the Soul, unleſs he could define better than other folks what the Soul is, and what the <hi>Breath of life</hi> is which <hi>God breathed into man,</hi> by which <hi>he became a living Soul,</hi> his raking up ſeeming contradictions about it tends to no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies profit that I know of. As fot what he tells us of the <hi>Raniers</hi> ſaying, The Soul is a part of God; therefore to talk of going to hell is an idle ſtory; is very idle in <hi>D. L.</hi> to cite. For I do believe, as man continued a living ſoul to God, by vertue of that life which God breathed into him, and as he is reſtored thereto again by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in that ſtate Hell is not his portion<hi>:</hi> Yet till then the Soul is not living to God, but death and hell is it's po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tion; for the Soul ſimply is one thing, and its being a living ſoul to God, is ſurely another thing.</p>
            <p>In p<hi>:</hi> 18: 19 he cites G, F, again thus, <q>Great Miſtery, p, 205 and p. 63. The Saints came to ſe the end of Sabbaths and New-Moons, and witneſſed the body, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> before the day was made—for the body is the light of the world, the body is the life given for the life of the World, in whom there is reſt<hi>—Chriſt</hi> gave himſelf, his body, for the life of the World; he was the offering for ſin.</q> Now <hi>D. L.,</hi> to make <hi>W. P.</hi> contradict <hi>G F<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> quotes out his <hi>Serious A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology</hi> p. 146 as follows, <q>But that the outward perſon that ſuffered was properly the Son of God, We utterly deny<hi>—A Body beſt thou prepared me,</hi>
               </q> ſaid the Son; ſot he Son was not the Body, though the body was the Son's Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which ſaies <hi>D<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> L.</hi> 
               <q>Let <hi>W P.</hi> reconcile theſe, and alſo tell us who is the Father of that outward perſon.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:45026:14"/>
               <hi>Anſw</hi> Eaſily reconciled<hi>:</hi> For as <hi>W: P.</hi> denies the outward perſon to be properly the ſon of God; ſo <hi>G: F</hi>'s<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> words, as here laid down by <hi>D: L,</hi> do import the ſame: For he being there anſwering a Prieſt, who was mightily crying up the outward Sabbath, which according to ſcripture, <hi>was a ſhadow of things to come</hi> Coll 2. 16<hi>:</hi> 17 derected him to <hi>Chriſt</hi> the ſubſtance, or body of that ſhadow, and ſaid, the <hi>body is the life of the world, and the light of the world</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now what is this to <hi>W: P</hi>'s ſaying, <hi>The outward perſon is not properly the ſon of God:</hi> For ſurely, the body, which is the ſubſtance of the ſhadowy things under the law, is <hi>Chriſt</hi> indefinitely, which <hi>G: F.</hi> calls <hi>the light of the world</hi> &amp;c. But what <hi>W: P.</hi> meant, was reſtricted to his outwatd viſible perſon only; which ſurely none will ſay, that that of its self was properly <hi>the light and life of the world:</hi> ſo that what <hi>W: P.</hi> and G. F. both do ſay is true, and therefore no contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. And doth not <hi>D. L.</hi> know, that the words [body of Chriſt] have various ſignifications in ſcripture? As, firſt <hi>his Church</hi> is called <hi>his body</hi> Coll 1. 18. The bread of the paſſover is called his body by <hi>Chriſt</hi> him ſelf Matt 26 26. And that which ſuffered on the croſſ was alſo his body. Again the ſubſtance of ſhadowy ordinances (which is <hi>Chriſt</hi> is called the body, which was the body in G. <hi>F</hi>'s. ſence, in this place mentioned by <hi>D. L.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And where as <hi>D. L.</hi> would know of <hi>VV. P, who is the Fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her of that outward perſon?</hi> I preſuming that <hi>VV.</hi> P hath mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of more weight to exerciſe him ſelf in, than to anſwer ſuch ſort of cavilling folks, ſhall therefore undertake to tell him, and that according to ſcripture, <hi>He was the ſon of.</hi> David <hi>Matth.</hi> 1. 1 and as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to the <hi>Romans</hi> 1: 3 <hi>He was made of the ſeed of</hi> David <hi>according to the fleſh;</hi> which was the out<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ward perſon <hi>VV.</hi> P. meant Well! but how was he the ſon of God: why the next verſs ſhew, viz <hi>And dedared to be the ſon of God, with power according to the ſpirit of holineſs</hi> &amp;c. And now I cannot but often obſerve, how <hi>D. L.</hi> by his ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> does often hit his Friend G. <hi>K.</hi> a greivous box on the ear; for in <hi>The VVay</hi> caſt <hi>up</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:45026:14"/>
p. 104. G. <hi>K.</hi> ſaith, <q>He was the ſon of <hi>Mary, David</hi> and <hi>Ahraham</hi> according to the fleſh; but according to his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly nature, even as man, he was the ſon of God. And in p. 102 he ſaith, It is not the outward fleſh and blood, that is the man—but it is the ſould or inward man, that dwelleth in the outward fleſh and blood, that is the man moſt properly, ſuch as <hi>Chriſt</hi> was from the beginng. Surly now if <hi>D L.</hi> be impartial, he muſt take in in G. F's. errours in his next anniverſary book.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>D. L.</hi> falls upon <hi>VV.</hi> P. again p. 19. quoting his <hi>Reaſon againſt Railing</hi> p. 91 as follows <q>
                  <hi>Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our Debtors,</hi> were, (ſaith he) nothing can be more obvious, than that which is forgiven, is not paid; and if it is our duty ſo forgive without a ſatisfaction re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and that God is to forgive us, as we forgive them, then is a ſatisfaction totally excluded.</q> Now to make as if he contradicts him ſelf he cites <hi>Rejoynder</hi> p. 284. where ſaith <hi>D.</hi> L. <hi>VV.</hi> P. cites and defends, <q>We believe that <hi>Chriſt</hi> in us doth offer up a living ſacrifice to God for us, by which the wrath of God is appeaſed to us.</q> Where upon ſaith <hi>D.</hi> L. <q>Note a ſelf contradiction, for in the one he totally excludes a ſatisfaction, and in the other he grants it Anſwer.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Can <hi>D.</hi> L. be impartial here in? Does he not know, that where <hi>VV.</hi> P: denies it as a payment of a debt, it is in the <hi>Preſbyterian,</hi> rigid senſe, to wit <q>That man having tranſgreſſed the righteous law of God, and ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the penalty of eternal wrath, it's altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for God to remitt or forgive without a plenary ſatisfaction; and that there was no other way by which God could obtain ſatisfaction, or ſave men, than by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting the penalty of infinite wrath and vengeance on <hi>Jeuſs Chriſt</hi> the ſecond perſon of the Trinity, who for ſins paſt, preſent and to come, hath wholly born and paid it, to the offended infinite juſtice of his Father:</q> ſee W. P<hi>'s:</hi> very words <hi>Sandy Foundation</hi> p. 16, of which I ſhall ſpeak more when I come to his <hi>Numb:</hi> 30: But as to <hi>Chriſt</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:45026:15"/>
offering up in us, by which the wrath of God is appeaſed to us, <hi>VV,</hi> P, expleans in the next paragraph, to wit <q>that <hi>Chriſt</hi> offers himſelf in his children in the nature of a Me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>diatory Sacrifice; And further ſaith <hi>Chriſt</hi> as a Mediator can atone in the conſciences of his People at what time they fall under any miſcarriage if they unſeignedly repent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to 1 John 2, 1, 2. &amp;c.</q> Now it is one thing to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the wrath of God or man in a <hi>Mediatory</hi> way, and quite another thing to pay the debt that's due in ſuch a ſtrict ſenſe as aforeſaid. So that though W, P, denyed ſuch a ſatisfaction to be made in one book; yet he did neither expreſly nor conſequently own it in the other; therefore no contradiction.</p>
            <p>Now whereas <hi>D,</hi> L. askes <q>How many thouſand offerings this new Scripture makes of <hi>Chriſt;</hi>
               </q> as many Saints, ſo many times <hi>Chriſt</hi> offers himſelf up a Sacrifice, For this I ſhall refer him to his great Friend G, <hi>K,</hi> for ſatisfaction, if any thing beſides abuſing the <hi>Quakers</hi> will ſatisfie him, ſee G, <hi>K</hi>'s <hi>VVay Caſt up</hi> not yet retracted where in p, 157, 158, <q>he holds that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is a Mediator in the Saints, and that his Spirit as man, prayeth and maketh interceſſion on to God in the Saints, and cites <hi>Rom,</hi> 8 for it,</q> Now dare <hi>D,</hi> L. ſay, that the praying of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not an offering and living Sacrifice to God; and G, <hi>K.</hi> ſaith <q>
                  <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath done ſo from the beginning, by whom the children of God in all ages have received grace from God,</q> And in p, 109 G, <hi>K.</hi> tells how <q>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> Preacht <hi>Chriſt</hi> to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> in the time of their <hi>Heathenism,</hi> cruicified in them,</q> and cites <hi>Gal,</hi> 3 5 6 Now let G. <hi>K.</hi> tell <hi>D,</hi> L. how many crucifyings of <hi>Chriſt</hi> there is, ſo many heathen, ſo many times Chriſt crucified, But I ſay again, prejudice blinds man,</p>
            <p>Well now to make G, <hi>F,</hi> contradict W, P, in this matter, in his <hi>Numb,</hi> 30, he quotes <hi>Great Miſtery</hi> p 63, thus <q>
                  <hi>Chriſt</hi> gave himſelf, his body for de life of the world, he was the offering for the ſins of the Whole world, and paid the debt, and made ſatisfaction,</q> To which he implicitely op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes W, P. as before, to wit, that <q>a ſatisfaction is
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:45026:15"/>
totally excluded, and what is forgiven is not paid.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> What <hi>G: F.</hi> ſaid was in anſwer to a Prieſt that ſaid, <q>Every man ſhould not have his ſins pardonned;</q> Which <hi>G. F.</hi> did not deny, but told, how <q>
                  <hi>Chriſt</hi> gave himſelf an offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the ſins of the World,</q> and that he had enligthned every man coming into the World, that all through him might believe and (which was enough to ſhew, that though all man had not their ſins pardonned, yet all were put into ſuch a capacity, as that they might have their ſins pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, in as much as) <hi>Chriſt</hi> had offered himſelf for all (which many of the Profeſſors at that time dinyed) and which offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Father was well pleaſed with, and ſatisfied in, and ſo in that ſence he made ſatisfaction, according to <hi>G. F.,</hi> &amp; which <hi>W: P.</hi> in that very book viz <hi>Sandy Foundation</hi> p: 32 did really own viz <q>That <hi>Chriſt</hi> in life, doctrine and death, fulfilled his Fathers will, and offered up a moſt ſatisfact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory Sacrifice, but not (ſaid he) to pay God, or help him, as being otherwiſe unable to ſave men.</q> So that here we find <hi>W: P.</hi> owns <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſatisfaction, as wel as <hi>G: F.,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtill <hi>their faces look</hi> not <hi>contrary</hi> (rightly underſtood) as <hi>D: L.</hi> would, and does repreſent them.</p>

            <p>Again, in p 30. 31. he cites <hi>G.

            <p>In his p<hi>:</hi> 37. he quotes <hi>R.

            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Tis true (ſays <hi>G: W) Hen: More</hi> had finer and more excellent notions about the Reſurrection, than many other learned men, and aimed at the truth and ſpirituality there of, from the vision of the holy men recorded in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And then in order to make <hi>G: W.</hi> oppoſe him ſelf, as he would ſeem to ſuppoſe, he offers a quotation out of p. 372 of the ſame book viz this manner, viz <q>
                  <hi>G: W.</hi> cites <hi>H: More</hi> about the Reſurrection, ſaying, Fleſh and blood can not in herit the kingdom of God; and I think (ſaies he) there is the ſame reaſon of fleſh and bones, viz.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I underſtand natural fleſh and bones, not glorified. Thus he cites <hi>G: W.</hi> and then adds this Note, <q>
                  <hi>G: W.</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends this notion of <hi>H: More,</hi> as ſavouring of truth and ſpirituality, and yet renders thoſe <hi>Atheiſts</hi> that believe the ſame; for <hi>H: More</hi> does not here deny the Reſurrection of the ſame body that dyeth, only underſtands it muſt be glorified.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Anſw. Here he has abuſed <hi>G: VV.</hi> by leaving out the laſt part of his words; for after the words immortal and incorruptible <hi>G: VV.</hi> adds, <q>and yet the ſame for matter and ſubſtance, which words he has skipt over I ſuppoſe becauſe they did not ſuit his purpoſe.</q>
            </p>

            <p>Anſw.

            <p>Then 2 dly in the ſame page <hi>D: L.</hi> cites the ſame book in p. 41; thus, paraphraſing upon it. And in p. 41. he denies <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s bodily exiſtence without us.</p>
            <p>

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:45026:21"/>
it plainly appears, that <hi>G.</hi> W. only oppoſed thoſe terms (viz) <hi>Chriſt</hi> exiſting outwardly bodily without us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, that would ſeem to exclude his being as he is God, and as he is in men; and therefore ſaies to <hi>R. G.</hi> 
               <q>And is <hi>Chriſt</hi> the ſaviour as an outward bodily exiſtence or perſon without us diſtinct from God, and upon that conſideration to be worſhipped as God, yea or nay. &amp;c.</q> Now though <hi>G.</hi> W. oppoſes <hi>R. G's.</hi> doctrine of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s being or exiſtence to be outwardly and bodily without us; yet it does not at all follow from thence, that he believes, <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath not a body, that hath a being or exiſtence without us. It is one thing to maintain, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Saviour of the World hath a body exiſting whithout us wich G. W. denied not; and another thing to hold or maintain, that that bodily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence it ſelf is <hi>Chriſt</hi> the ſaviour of the world, which (and no leſs) <hi>R.</hi> G<hi>'s.</hi> words ſeem to import. The outward bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily exiſtence of a man cannot be ſaid ſtrictly to be the man, for them when it dies, and the bodily exiſtence is put off, the man would, ceaſe to be. And where it is ſaid of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that he <hi>bare ourſins in his own body on the three</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24; It might as well be ſaid, that the body bare our ſins on his own body on the tree. So that to conclude, I ſay it is a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt falſehood in <hi>D. L,</hi> to ſay that G.

our doctrine or phraſe that I know of or remember; only that the title is thought too low and unſcriptural, to give to the Chriſt of God, many men having groſs apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions about the phraſe <hi>[Perſon without]</hi> But Chriſt is confeſt us, both as without us, and within us.</q> Well<hi>!</hi> Where is the contradiction in all this? Why here; W. <hi>P,</hi> ſaies, <hi>That God ſent his ſon ſo many hundred years ago in perſon;</hi> and G. W, ſaies <hi>The title</hi> [perſon without] <hi>is thought too, low and unſcriptural to give to the Chriſt of God.</hi> Mark, <hi>perſon without us, was what</hi> was thought <hi>too low</hi> to be ſpoken concerning <hi>the ſon of God,</hi> it was not thought <hi>too low</hi> for it to be ſaid of him, <hi>that ſo many hundred year ſince he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in perſon:</hi> For it is one thing to ſay, <hi>That the ſon ſo many hundred years ago appeared in perſon,</hi> and another thing to ſay, <hi>That the ſon, or Chriſt of God is a perſon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us,</hi> especially when it is ſpoken in oppoſition to thoſe who deny him to be within us. For though we ſincerely believe Chriſt to be in heaven without us, yet we alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, according to ſcripture, that he is within us the hope of glory and that if Chriſt be not in us we are Reprobates.</p>
            <p>Now whether <hi>D.

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:45026:23"/>
and forgeries he is guilty of in the beforegoing.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now proceed to his <hi>third Chapter,</hi> which I find much like his former, it being grounded upon his not being willing to diſtinguiſh, in aſcriptural ſenſe, between Chriſt as he was from the beginning, and as he came in the body in the fulneſs of time.</p>
            <p>As for what he here ſaith of <hi>John Whitehead,</hi> I refer the Reader to <hi>Tho. Ellwood's</hi> book, Called <hi>Truth Defended</hi> &amp;c. p. 124.</p>
            <p>As for his saying, That The true <hi>Chrſtians</hi> believe that the true Chriſt hath a body of fleſh and bones &amp;c. To this I anſwer, That how, or after what manner, Chriſt's body is now in heaven I ſhall by no means undertake to determine' it being (I believe) a bove the capacity of us Mortals ſo to do: But I ſhall tell <hi>D. L.</hi> that he hereby brings his great friend <hi>G. K.</hi> under his cenſure of not being a true <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> for <hi>G: K.</hi> expreſly ſaith of Chriſt's body, that, <q>It is no more a body of fleſh blood and bone, but a pure Aethereal heavenly body, ſee <hi>Way caſt up</hi> p. 131 not retracted.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Then, for his bantering <hi>W: P.</hi> about his calling Chriſt's body holy: ſaying <q>Can this be other than hypocrisy? "for as is noted at <hi>Numb</hi> 49 50, he holds the body to be earthly and periſhing.</q> I would have the Reader note, it proceeds from <hi>W: P</hi>'s vindicating this ſaying ſo <hi>Jſaac "Peningtons'</hi> 
               <q>That which Chriſt took upon him was but the garment of our nature, which is of an earthly and periſhing nature.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, That Chriſt's body was a holy body ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>W.</hi> P. Surely <hi>D. L.</hi> will not deny; Yet that it was the garment of our nature is not (me thinks) hard to make out: For it is ſaid <hi>Heb:</hi> 2<hi>:</hi> 14 <hi>For as much then as the children are partakers of fleſh and blood, he alſo him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf likewiſe took part of the ſame</hi> [Mark of the ſame] Now how it is the ſame, if not of the ſame nature, for my part I know not; though Chriſt defiled not his nature
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:45026:24"/>
by ſin, as we have done ours, is Certain; and there fore a holy body according to <hi>W<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> P:</hi> Yet in as much as <hi>he took on him</hi> the ſeed of Abraham, he ſurely took on him our nature, unleſs the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> be not of our nature, and that this is the garment which <hi>Is. P</hi> meant, I ſuppoſe <hi>D. L.</hi> will not deny<hi>:</hi> Nay the ſcripture ſaith expreſly v. 17. <hi>In all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethern</hi> Yet though Chriſt was in all things made like unto his breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, though he took <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hould of the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and took part of the ſame fleſh and blood with us, which fleſh and blood of ours is ſurely of an arthly and periſhing nature; Yet I utterly deny <hi>D: L</hi>'s inference, that <hi>W: P.</hi> renders Chriſt's body earthly and periſhing: For though he took part of the ſame fleſh and blood with us which fleſh and blood of ours (as I ſaid) is of an earthly and periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nature; yet by the mighty power of God, Chriſt's bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was raiſed from the dead, and ſaw no corruption, and ſo he dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him, but he ever liveth to make interceſſion for us, in his ſoul and ſpirit and glorious and heavenly body.</p>
            <p>I come next to touch upon one paſſage in his <hi>Chap.</hi> 4, where he thinks he hath gotten I know not what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage againſt <hi>W: P,</hi> He cites <hi>VV: P</hi>'s. <hi>Reaſon againſt Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> p. 165. where <hi>D.</hi> L. ſaies <q>W.

And yet (ſaies <hi>D</hi> L) in <hi>Addreſs to Proteſtants</hi> p. 242, he at once unchriſtians himſelf and all his Brethren, for ſo doing, for ſaith he, Men that call names for Religion, may tell us they are Chiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, if they will, but no body would know them to be ſuch by their fruits, to be ſure they are no <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of Chriſt's making.</q> Upon which <hi>D.

               </q> Now where will <hi>D: L</hi>'s ſincerity and impartiality be, if he deal not with <hi>G: K,</hi> as he hath dealt with us in this matter.</p>
            <p>Then as to what he offers to prove that W<hi>:</hi> P. unchriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians him ſelf and Brethren at once, becauſe he ſaith (as <hi>D: L.</hi> quotes him) Men that call names for religion may tell they are <hi>Chriſtians</hi> if they will &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:45026:25"/>
I <hi>anſwer</hi> Here he hath very unfairly left out that part of <hi>VV: P</hi>'s. words which would unqueſtionably have ſhewn ſuch men he there diſcreyd to be no <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> For <hi>VV: P.</hi> being there treating concerning and ſpeaking againſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors, he hath it thus, viz, <q>Men that call names for religion and fling ſtones and perſecute for faith, may tell us they are <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> if they will, but no body would know them to be ſuch, by their fruits.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now theſe words [and fling ſtones and perſecute for faith] <hi>D: L.</hi> hath concealed from his Reader, and I am ſure, that is a worſe errour than <hi>a little failure in Syntax.</hi> But by inſerting them, my Reader may ſee what ſort of men they were, whom <hi>VV: P.</hi> rejected, as unworthy of that honourable name, viz <hi>Perjecutors for faith, flingers of ſtones as well as callers of names for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligon;</hi> And it is well known, that ſuch perſecutors, in formers and others, would not only fling ſtones, but throw di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t too, and alſo call ſuch names as theſe; <hi>You Quaking Curr, You Anabaptiſt Rogue, You Fanatick Dog,</hi> and the like; Now it is clear, that this was the calling names for Religion which W. P. meant, and not the calling of names after the manner as the Prophet did, when he called a ſort of men, <hi>Greedy Dogs</hi> &amp;c. nor after the manner as <hi>E: B.</hi> did, when he called ſuch like men, <hi>Sot Sorcerer</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But perhaps <hi>D: L.</hi> will ſay in vindication of <hi>G. K,</hi> that he hath retracted the hard names by him given to his Oppoſers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That Retractation is but a meer flam like ſome of the reſt: For how far hath he retracted this? Why his words are of ſo large an extent, that's that I know no Profeſſor of Chriſtianity but both might and would ſay as much and yet retract juſt nothing at all, neither would there be any ſervice in it in order to give the leaſt ſatiſfact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion to any concerned who might ſuppoſe themſelves abuſed by hard names publiſhed; for his retractation is only in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral terms (viz <q>He retracts in general all the hard names that he hath given to ſuch as did nor deſerve them) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out discharding any particular perſon or ſociety from the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:45026:25"/>
ſcandal of thoſe hard names.</q> For inſtance G. K. in his Antichriſts and Saducees detected hath beſtowed many hard names upon me, as Antichriſt, Saducee or rather Atheiſt, Bold Ignorant, Miller Philoſopher &amp;c. Now ſince there is great probability that he doth not mean me to be one of thoſe upon whoſe account he hath retracted the hard names given; So alſo any of his former Opponents to whom he hath given hard names may ſay I know not that he means me to be one of them who have not (in his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) deſerved them, and now although he ſeems to make an acknowledgment and blame himſelf for beſtowing hard names on divers, yet ſince he names none of thoſe divers what ſatiſfaction to me is his pretended retraction in this more than his charging them on me in his former, and what ſincerity doth he manifeſt in it? For thoſe divers he hints at either did occur to his memory at the writing of his book or thy did not: If they did, and he ſincere in his pretenſion he ſhould have named them; but if they did not then it is a ſign he put down what he publiſhed by meer rote and in ſhort, he had as good have ſaid nothing about it ſince every particular perſon concerned in thoſe hard names may ſay they are never the more ſatisfied there by and ſo all of them ſtill lye at <hi>G: K</hi>'s door.</p>
            <p>Upon pruiſal of his 5th. Chapter about propheſies I find not above one that he hath mentioned which hath failed: For thoſe he ſpeaks of who have of late propheſied againſt ſeveral towns and places, I never heard that any prefixed a time, nor otherwaies than upon condition, viz unleſs they did repent, which whether there was not ſo much repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in ſo many of them as might move the Lord to a farther compaſſion on them is ſurely more than this D<hi>:</hi> L: knows.</p>
            <p>(As for <hi>D: L</hi>'s ridiculing <hi>G: VV.</hi> about his propheſie concetning <hi>G: K.</hi> viz <q>And thus ſaith the Lord, becauſe thou haſt poured out contempt, ſcorn and reproach upon my ſervants and people, I will aſſuredly pour out and bring great contempt and ſcorn upon thee.</q>

I <hi>anſwer,</hi> What farther ſcorn and contempt may yet come upon him, than what is already come and manifeſt to the world, even ſince thoſe words were written by <hi>G: VV.</hi> let time ſhew, and daies to come make yet more manifeſt: For ſcorn and contempt is certainly come upon him, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the conceit which <hi>D.

And as for <hi>Robert Ewer</hi> There was not ſo near an unity bewixt him and our Friends, a conſiderable time before that buſineſs of that Woman at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> was talked of, as <hi>D: L.</hi> may poſſibly imagine; But it is not the Churches place to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own any Member, before proof be made, of ſome evil done by him or her, and to prove what I ſay, I hope<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor very ſufficient in <hi>D: L</hi>'s eye, for it is no leſs perſon than his great friend <hi>G: K.</hi> who in his late book of <hi>Retracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> O groſs perverter? I remember he tells me in p. 45. that about the Reſurrection I carnally apprehend <hi>G.

                  <hi>Duſt ſhall thou eat all the daies of thy life</hi> Gen. 3. 14.</q> Yet that the conſequence is, that theſe two expreſſions, according to <hi>G.

            <p>And now I ſhall deſire the Reader to excuſe my ſtepping back to p. 70, where I find <hi>D. L.</hi> falſly accuſing <hi>Tho. Ell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> of <hi>belying the Common Creed,</hi> quoting his <hi>Truth De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:45026:28"/>
p. 70, on this wiſe, viz, <q>The common Creed (ſaies he) called the Apoſtles, Creed, ſaies Chriſt was conceived by the holy Ghoſt,</q> Though born of the Virgin: vvhere upon <hi>D: L.</hi> ſaies Now pray ſearch the Common Creed, and ſee if the word [though] be there to be found.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Theſe words [though born of the Virgin] which <hi>D: L.</hi> quarrels with, are not laid down by <hi>T: E,</hi> as the expreſs words of the Creed, but rather as explanatory in order to ſhew the import thereof, which was; That though Chriſt was born of the Virgin, yet he was conceived by the Holy Ghoſt, and that therefore, his Generation was not by coagulation, of, and from the properties of man in <hi>Mary</hi> (as had been ſuggeſted) ſince <hi>Mary</hi> had not known man, but the holy child <hi>Jeſus,</hi> though born of her, was conceived by the holy Ghoſt. And I am ſure <hi>D: L.</hi> will be hard put to it, to prove <hi>T: E.</hi> a lyar in this caſe; he may as well prove the Apoſtle a lyar, in a paſſage <hi>Heb:</hi> 4<hi>:</hi> 3 where he hath relation to an expreſſion of the Psalmiſts, <hi>Psal.</hi> 95. 11: viz, <hi>As he ſaid, As I have ſworn in my wrath, if they ſhall enter into my reſt: although the works were finiſhed from the foundation of the World.</hi> Now theſe words [al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>though the works were finiſhed &amp;c.] are not the <hi>Pſalmiſt's</hi> words, but the Apoſtles, explanatory of what he had before ſaid in the ſame verſe, viz, <hi>For we which have believed do enter into reſt:</hi> And <hi>T: E</hi>'s words were much after the ſame manner and way of ſpeaking, therefore how poor, mean and pitiful muſt it be in <hi>D: L,</hi> to employ himſelf, in prying into, and poring upon our books in order to find matter againſt us, whileſt, when he has done all he is able, he can produce nothing, but ſuch weak and ſilly ſtuff.</p>
            <p>As wretchedly fordid and baſe is he in p. 71; in abuſing G<hi>:</hi> W. whom he quotes thus; <hi>Counter Convert</hi> p. 26 <q>We prefer the holy Scriptures (ſaith he) before all the Books extant in the world.

the book called the Bible, before all books extemt &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> This is a moſt wicked and baſe inſinuation, as if, when <hi>G: W.</hi> mentions our preferring the Scripture, he did not thereby intend the Bible. I am perſvvaded, it is not only contrary to <hi>D: L's</hi> beleif, but alſo to his very knowledge: Beſides, though other books are, and may be written, by the aſſiſtance, and from the dictates of the Spirit of God; yet that doth not hinder the book called the Bible, from having the preference, all things conſidered. Gold and Silver money are both ſtamped vvith the Kings Image and ſuperſcription, and both are allowed by him to be current Coin, yet the one is preferible to the other. And, vvhereas our Friends, amongſt many other, have ſaid, that ſome Scriptures are corrupted, yet that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not, but in the main, they are preferible to all other books<hi>:</hi> Gold may have ſome tincture of a meaner metal in it, yet in the main 'tis preferible to all other met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als.</p>
            <p>Again, what a groſs inference hath he drawn, from the words he quotes as <hi>Sam: Fiſher's</hi> viz <q>That were their tranſcriptions and tranſlations never ſo certain and entire, by anſwering to the firſt original Copies, yet are not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be to all men any other than a <hi>Lesbian</hi> Rule or noſe of wax; Whereupon <hi>D:</hi> L. ſaies, Mark how he affirms, That if the Scripures were never ſo true, yet they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being no other than a noſe of wax.</q>

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:45026:29"/>
are capable of being no other (indefinitely) than a noſe of Wax.</p>
            <p>Well! upon this perverſion of the above quotation <hi>D: L.</hi> comments, ſaying; <q>Now I dare affirm, there is no ſort of people elſe in <hi>Criſtendom,</hi> except <hi>Papiſts,</hi> will ſpeak thus of the Scriptures. But experience tells me, That all ſenſible <hi>Chriſtians</hi> who proteſt againſt this Popiſh prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, cannot but have an evidence in themſelves to the worth and purity of the Scriptures &amp;c.</q>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> A high charge indeed! and that too to be foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon ſuch an honeſt and innocent expreſſion; For what though (as <hi>D: L:</hi> quotes him) <hi>W.

Yet ſurely none vvill think; that they ſo ovvned them, as to ovvn that in them vvhich vvas corrupt<hi>:</hi> No, they vvere ſo far from that, as they did not ſpare to tell them of it; <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaies, <hi>Thy Princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves,</hi> &amp;c. ſee <hi>ch.</hi> 1<hi>:</hi> 23, and <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſaies <hi>ch.</hi> 21: 27. <hi>Her Princes in the midſt Thereof are like wolves ravening the prey, to ſhed blood</hi> &amp;c.

next, whether in ſo doing, he would, or ought to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted one that pretends to be what he really is not? Let him well conſider this.</p>

            </p>
            <p>I <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Though I know not that ever I ſaw the book he refers to; yet it really ſeems to me, to be written upon the occaſion of ſo much contending, fighting, killing and deſtroying one another, in ſtriving who ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But that this contradicts <hi>W: P,</hi> or that <hi>W: P.</hi> contradicts this, by his peaceably obtaining a grant from the King, of the Government here, as <hi>D: L.</hi> ſeems to inſinuate in theſe words, viz; <q>
                  <hi>Come mark that</hi> W.

            <p>Then whereas he obſerves, <hi>that Antient ſtory hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him, that all</hi> Chriſtian Societies <hi>have apoſtatized, when they grew numerous:</hi> I ſhall now obſerve likewiſe, and put him in mind too, how the ſcene is altered; and that modern ſtory can now inform him of a Society of People lately founded in <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> and his great Friends who (like thoſe that antient ſtory informs us of, though they were apoſtatized from the light, life and ſpirit of Chriſt; yet would ſtill retain to themſelves the honourable name of Chriſtians; ſo thoſe of this nevv Society) though they were gone from the unity and ſocjety of the people cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Quakers,</hi> at the firſt, would by all means value themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves much, upon their retaining that name, and that forſooth of the moſt pure and moſt primitive ſort too, and therefore muſt be diſtinguiſhed by the name of <hi>Chriſtian Quakers.</hi> That theſe are ſo apoſtatized, within the ſpace of about
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:45026:31"/>
ſeven years, notwithſtanding their not growing numerous, that ſcarce any of them will own the name; But like <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels Builders</hi> are ſtrangely divided amongſt themſelves; and truly look upon it as a judgment befallen them for their lofty tower building: ſome being gone to the water, viz ſome to dipping one another; and ſome to ſprinkling with the old popiſh Ceremony of <hi>God-Fathers</hi> and <hi>God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Mothers:</hi> ſome ſtaying at home, and leaving all <hi>Chriſtian Societies:</hi> others running into ſtrange notions, as that there are two Gods, and that one of them dyed &amp;c. Some (though very few) now and then keeping a meeting, poſſibly pretty near the manner of their primitive practice. And Thus is <hi>the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage</hi> of theſe <hi>Babel</hi> Builders <hi>confounded,</hi> and themſelves <hi>ſcattered abroad,</hi> ſo that they have already almoſt <hi>left off to build the City and the Tower.</hi> God grant they may be a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to all others, for the future.</p>
            <p>But to wave any farther digreſſion, I come again to the point, and do ſay, That as it is clear, that what <hi>W. P.</hi> wrote there, was intended againſt thoſe who uſed ſuch like worldly weapons, in the carrying on of Religious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: So it is alſo clear, that he never thereby meant to inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate, as if Chriſt upon his coming into the world, or offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up himſelf, had put an end, or commanded an end to be put to all outward Government in matters Civil: For in the ſame page, <hi>W. P.</hi> intimates; <q>That Chriſt came to reform the lives of men, and to make them better ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to obey <hi>Ceſar</hi> &amp;c,</q> So that if ſubjects be owned, Princes, &amp;c. muſt be owned likewiſe; And ſeeing <hi>W. P</hi> owned, that Chriſt came to make men better ſubjects to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey <hi>Ceſar,</hi> by conſequence he muſt needs have owned, that Chriſt did allow of a <hi>Ceſar</hi> to command ſuch obedience; And I dare ſay, Whoſoever ſhall read that, or any other of <hi>W. P's,</hi> books, ſhall find nothing to the contrary: But for him to charge <hi>W: P:</hi> with Apoſtacy, becauſe of his being concerned in civil Government, is prepoſterous; and I further ſay, for Friends to be concerned in the civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, is no waies inconſiſtent with their antient
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:45026:31"/>
principles, or practice either, when they have been called to it by Authority, without an oath: therefore D: L's. inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation againſt <hi>W: P:</hi> and us, as if we were <hi>ceaſed to be Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian,</hi> becauſe concerned therein, is groundleſs, and a meer begging of the Queſtion.</p>
            <p>Another fling D. L. has in this 81ſt pa. againſt W: P, as follows, viz <q>But ſome think W: P<hi>:</hi> has wit enough to make out to all that ſee with his eyes, that the ſword of the Magiſtrate viz <hi>Conſtable's ſtaves, Sheriff's weapons, Stocks, Priſons and Gallows</hi> are not worldly weapons, out ſpiritual weapons, when uſed by <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> An idle ſtory<hi>:</hi> One would think he were violently ſeized with the itch of ſcribling, For where did W<hi>:</hi> P: ever take upon him to prove or make out to any man any ſuch thing? Beſides, I never urderſtood, that a <hi>Conſtable's ſtaff</hi> was counted a weapon, he being but a Civil Officer, and his place to keep the peace; but rather that it is a mark or badge of his office, whence it is common with people, when a <hi>Conſtable</hi> comes to ſerve a Warrant upon any perſon, and brings not his Staff with him to ask him, where it is? And I my ſelf was once a <hi>Sheriff,</hi> but neither before, then, nor ſince, did I ever underſtand, that ſuch a thing as a weapon, peculiarly belonged to, or was eſſentially need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in, the due execution of that Office. Then as for <hi>Stocks, Priſon and Gallows,</hi> he may call them weapons if he pleaſe, but for my part I do not think them ſo; much leſs that they come under the Apoſtle's denomination of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, when he ſaies 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10: 4, <hi>The weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty trough God to the pulling down of ſtrong holds</hi> &amp;c. For the weapons which the Apoſtle here oppoſes to carnal, being ſuch wherewith they pulled down ſtrong holds, ſeems to me to allude to ſuch outward wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, with which the warriours of old did ſight, and pull down outward ſtrong holds; Conſequently, did not allude to the ſtrong holds themſelves, which (in a ſenſe) Stocks and Priſons are. So then, where the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:45026:32"/>
weapons of their warfare not being carnal, he cannot thereby be ſuppoſed to intend or allude to ſtocks, priſons, or the like, but rather to thoſe weapons, with which they of old uſed to pull them down. As for his ſly inſinuation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>W: P's</hi> making out to the people, that Stocks, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable's ſtaves, Priſons, Gallows &amp;c. are ſpiritual weapons, when uſed by the <hi>Quakers;</hi> I ſhall only ſay thus much, I can not think, but that he knows better, than he writes, in this Caſe, as well as in many other matters; and ſurely the greater will be his condemnation in the great day of Account, which they (though falſly) ſo much accuſe us of denying.</p>
            <p>In his 9th. <hi>Chapter,</hi> entituled <hi>Of Perſecution, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution,</hi> the firſt thing I ſhall take notice of, is the great Adoe he makes, about ſome of his Friends in <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> being called to account for belying and abuſing the Magiſtrates, and Authority of the place, pretending it was for matters purely Religious, and therefore being only a Religious difference (as they falſly alledged) they ought not to have been troubled for it, and the like; which I have partly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in <hi>Modeſt Account,</hi> from p<hi>:</hi> 39 to p: 43. Yet when <hi>G: K:</hi> got into <hi>England,</hi> and into the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Londons</hi> favour, how quickly did he himſelf there fall to that work really, which but a little before, he had falſly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected againſt others in <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> by inſtigating, ſtirring up and endeavouring to prevail with Authority in <hi>England,</hi> to give order, not only to enter into our Meeting houſes; but alſo to ſearch for our Books, and when found, to have them diligently ſearched and examined by the moſt pious and judicious  and if found guilty of vile and groſs errours of which, no queſtion, but fle and the Clergy muſt be judges) to ſuppreſs them by publick Authority; and that for no other reaſon, but pretended errours in doctrine contained in them? And now if this do not ariſe from a Spirit of Perſecution: I know not what doth; for preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded errours in Doctrine, have been the chief arguments al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, for ſtirring up all the perſecutions, which have
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:45026:32"/>
inſeſted <hi>Criſtendom,</hi> for about theſe 100 Years. Let us alſo conſider, what may be the effect of ſuch a work, if <hi>G. K.</hi> could but obtain his end, in having his propoſal effected; Why then, it would be but getting ſome ſuch perſons, as perhaps himſelf, and chief friends ſhall call pious and judicious to fall to the work, and the buſineſs might ſoon go on briskly<hi>:</hi> And then our peaceable Meetings, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence the Nations peace in ſome meaſure, would be diſturbed again; our Shops and Houſes might with violence be entered into, and the Bookſellers might poſſibly have many hundred pounds worth of books ſeized at once, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any evil committed by them, as well as without tryal, before either Iudge or Iury, except <hi>G: K:</hi> and ſuch as he ſhall call pious and judicious. So that this Suffering propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by him, would not be on a like ground with their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſuffering he complains of here, viz, for calling a Governour <hi>Impudent man,</hi> telling him, <hi>He was not fit to be Governour;</hi> for belying Magiſtrates (as they did here) in print, about their proceedings in the adminiſtration of Juſtice, alſo for falſly inſinuating againſt Magiſtrates, <hi>that one was ſo drunk, that he was fain to be carried to bed; and that another was ſo drunk, that he could ſcarce ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> over the ſhips ſide he was in,</hi> with ſuch like ſtuff, which <hi>G: K:</hi> and his company here (in their impetuous heat to vent their malice on ſome then in authority in this place, and to render them as odious, as well they could) did not ſtick to publiſh, to their great abuſe. But alas<hi>!</hi> the caſe (on ſuch an occaſion as aforeſaid) would be far otherwiſe with the <hi>Quakers</hi> in <hi>England:</hi> For having no ſuch like things as theſe, juſtly to lay to their charge there, their ſuffering would be only on the ſcore of pretended errours in Doctrine, which (as I ſaid) is the common pretence of moſt Perſecutors. Yet ſince <hi>D: L:</hi> and <hi>G: K:</hi> flout ſo much at infallible deſcerning, I would ask them, Upon what pretence they would undertake to paſs judgment upon our books? If they ſay, by the Authority of the Holy Scriptures, Who then (ſay I) muſt be Iudge of the Comment? For
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:45026:33"/>
it is about that, that Perſecutors generally differ with the Perſecuted. Therefore were <hi>D: L:</hi> ſincere and impartial as he pretends to be; ſince he takes upon him to inveigh ſo much, againſt the pretended perſecution of thoſe here, why ſhould he be ſo mute, as not to rebuke, or ſo much as take one word of notice, of <hi>G: K's</hi> real endeavours to ſtir up thoſe in Authority in <hi>England,</hi> to a real perſecution there: Since (although the book wherein thoſe paſſages are contained, was publiſhed before the <hi>Retractation</hi> book came forth, yet) he hath not (there in) retracted them<hi>:</hi> And yet <hi>D: L:</hi> pretends, he would have taken in <hi>G: K's</hi> books, together with ours, if he had not rertracted hi errours: but his Cloak is too ſhort, and his covering too narrow, to hide his exceeding great partiality under, as in ſeveral places of this book I have ſhewn, particularly in this e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe.</p>
            <p>The next thing I ſhall take notice of, is his mentioning our Friends ancient Teſtimony concerning <hi>bearing injuries,</hi> ſo as <hi>being rev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>led not to revile again;</hi> and alſo their cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt thoſe <hi>who cauſed people to be put in priſon, and took away their goods</hi> upon a religious account, and the like, comparing it with <hi>George Keith, Thomas Budd, John Mc Combe, William Bradford and Peter Boſs</hi> their being called to account for their abuſes to the Government, ſee p: 81 to 86. Now this is fallacious, for they hold no parallel, and therein at moſt he doth but meerly beg the Queſtion, they being not called to account about any Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Difference, as I have already ſhown.</p>
            <p>For I do believe, had any other Perſons (though they had been ſuch as had never in the leaſt differed with us about Religious matters) done as <hi>G: K:</hi> and his Company did, they would not have eſcaped the notice of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, any more than <hi>G: K:</hi> &amp;c. I would therefore have them, and all others, duly, and in ſincerity and truth, weigh this matter in the right ballance; for although our Friends have teſtified, <hi>That we ought to bear injuries</hi> &amp;c. and accordingly have born the injurious Revilings, Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonments
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:45026:33"/>
and Spoiling of Goods, acknowledging it our Principle ſo to do, when inflicted on any of us for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake; Yet on the other hand, we alwaies owned <hi>Magiſtracy to be an Ordinance of God,</hi> and that <hi>it was for the puniſhment of evil doers, and to preſerve mens Lives, Liberties and Properties;</hi> ſee <hi>Edward Burroughs's Works</hi> p: 784: 785. And likewiſe it hath been the practice of our Friends from the beginning, to endeavour to recover their juſt Rights, by due courſe of Law from thoſe who were not under the regulation of our Church diſcipline, nor would otherwiſe be perſwaded to do the thing that was juſt and right, notwithſtanding <hi>D<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> L's</hi> undue and ſtrained conſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of our words relating to bearing Jnjuries &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And whereas in his p: 82 he gives us a quotation, ſaid to be taken out of <hi>Sam. Jennings</hi> his <hi>State of the Caſe,</hi> p. I know not what, which he makes to ſpeak to this purpoſe viz That they could do no leſs than proſecute, and fine <hi>G: K:</hi> and <hi>T: B:</hi> without the violation of their Truſt to the King.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, Since he hath not mentioned the page, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell wether or no he hath laid down <hi>S. J's</hi> words fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; he is not a man fit to be truſted in ſuch caſes, for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons already ſhewn: But be it as it will, it appears from <hi>D. L's</hi> citation it ſelf; that it was not ſelf revenge they ſought, but to prevent the violation of their Truſt.</p>
            <p>And therefore <hi>D. L.</hi> had no manner of ground, to caution our Preachers to keep their Hearers from reading that part of <hi>Robert Barclay's Apology,</hi> which he hath quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his p: 89; For <hi>R. B.</hi> is not there treating at all of Civil Government, but of Revenge and War, as his expreſs words are, and therefore he complains that <q>The Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an world is fallen in to contempt of Chriſt's Law, not only as to oaths, curſings, blaſphemous prophanations and horrid perjuries; but alſo, how the world is filled with violence, oppreſſion, murthers, raviſhing of Women and Virgins, ſpoilings, depredations, burnings, vaſtations and all manner of laſciviouſneſs and cruelty.</q> But not one
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:45026:34"/>
word hath he againſt the Civil Magiſtrates appointing the juſt Laws to be executed upon Evil doers; nor that it is unlawfull for men to recover ther juſt Rights, by due proceſs, according to the juſt and equal laws of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, under which they live. And as I could produce ſeveral inſtances out of our ancient Friends writings, to prove, that from the beginning, it was againſt our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to be concerned in outward Wars and Fightings; So I could alſo produce divers inſtances, that from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it was not againſt our principles to be concerned in outward Government. I ſhall at preſent only mention two.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Edward Burroughs,</hi> in his book entituled <hi>A juſt and righteous Plea, preſented to the King of</hi> England &amp;c. declares to the King and Council, in the name of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> as may be ſeen in p. 784. 785 of his <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection</hi> (hinted at above) that, <q>We do acknowledge Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Rule and Magiſtracy to be an Ordinance of God, ordained and inſtituted of him, to be exerciſed among the children of men. And we beleive there ought to be Rule and Government and Authority, exercized and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in every Kingdom, Nation, City and Country, for the end aforeſaid; to wit, that Evil doers may be made afraid and corrected, limited, reſtrained and ſubdued, that ſin and tranſgreſſion may be ſuppreſſed, and truth and righteouſneſs promoted, and them that do well praiſed, and ſtrengthned. And this is the very end of outward government of Kings, Princes, or other amongſt men upon the Earth; even that the outward man may be kept in good order and ſubjection, in his converſation in the world, and may be limited and reſtrained, from all wrong doing or ſpeaking, againſt his Neighbours Perſon or Eſtate; and if he do, he is puniſhable by ſuch juſt Authority. 2dly. The exerciſe and execution of this juſt Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment over the outward man, as afore deſcribed, ought to be committed into the hands of ſaithful, juſt and upright Men, ſuch as fear the Lord, and hate covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and every evil way, and not to drunkards, lyars,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:45026:34"/>
covetous or evil minded perſons, ambitious or vain glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious perſons, in any Nation &amp;c.</q> 
               <q>And in p. 751. he hath it thus viz I have before mentioned, what kind of Rulers and Governours we would have; even ſuch as are juſt men, and men of Truth and Righteouſneſs, that hate covetouſneſs and every evil way, and ſuch are of us &amp;c.</q> [Mark <hi>ſuch are of us].</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond is <hi>Richard Hubberthorn,</hi> who was alſo an ancient Preacher and Writer amongſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and who (as did alſo <hi>Edward Burrough)</hi> dyed ſo long ago, as in the year 1662. In his diſcourſe with King <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond, the King asked him thus, as may be ſeen in the: printed account p. <hi>King.</hi> 
               <q>How do you own Magiſtrates and Magiſtracy? <hi>R. H.</hi> Thus we do own Magiſtrates. Whoſoever is ſet up by God, whether King as Supream, or any ſet in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity by him, who are for the puniſhment of evil doers, and the praiſe of them that do well, ſuch we ſhall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unto, and aſſiſt in righteous and civil things, both by body and eſtate; And if any Magiſtrate do that which is unrighteous, we muſt declare againſt it, only ſubmitting under it, by a patient ſuffering, and not rebel againſt any, by inſurrections, plots or contrivances. <hi>King:</hi> Then the King ſaid, That is enough. Now in this diſcource there are two things obſervable; Firſt, <hi>That we owned Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> &amp;c. and Secondly, We then declared, <hi>We ſhould ſubmit to them, and aſſiſt them in righteous and civil things</hi> [Mark aſſiſt] <hi>both by body and eſtate.</hi>
               </q> So that here we ſee he declared, we could aſſiſt the Government in righteous and civil things, not only with our Eſtates; but alſo with our Bodies: therefore, ſo to do is not contrary to our ancient Friends Teſtimonies.</p>
            <p>In p. 85. mentioning <hi>Peter Boſs's</hi> tryal, he has a fling at <hi>David Lloyd;</hi> on this wiſe <q>In the tryal of which (ſaith he) <hi>D. Lloyd,</hi> being Attorney, pleaded for <hi>S. J.</hi> and read a caſe out of an old Law book, to this effect, <hi>That though <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t Biſhop was ſeen to be drunk, yet he was not to be reproved.</hi>
               </q> In anſwer thereto, <hi>David Lloyd</hi> denies, that he brought
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:45026:35"/>
any ſuch inſtance, or that he ſo much as knows of any ſuch caſe in any Law-book whatſoever.</p>
            <p>In p. 86. he gives us a pretended ſpeech of <hi>Arthur Cook's</hi> on this wiſe, viz; <q>Well, ſeeing Friends that you are not like to agree, you are abſolved from your Teſt (or Oath) and are discharged; and we wil have another Jury that ſhall agree, and find the bill.</q> To this, <hi>Arthur Cook</hi> and others then concerned, whom I have discourſed with, ſay, that No ſuch expreſſion dropt from him, ſo far as they can recollect; But that he did deliver his opinion; <hi>That ſeeing the Jury could not agree, another inqueſt ſhould be awarded, as the law in that caſe directs.</hi> So that I have ſufficient reaſon to conclude, that this great noiſe, is no other than a falſe, as well as baſe inſinuation, againſt both the <hi>Court</hi> and <hi>Arthur Cook,</hi> in order to repreſent them all, to be ſuch manner of perſons, as were reſolved to have the bill found in that caſe, right or wrong.</p>
            <p>In p. 87. mentioning a law made in <hi>England;</hi> 
               <q>That no <hi>Quaker</hi> or reputed <hi>Quaker</hi> ſhall ſerve on any Juries, or bear any Office or Place of profit in the Government; he makes this reflection,</q> 
               <q>They may ſee what their ill man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in <hi>Pennſilvania</hi> has brought on them &amp;c.</q> To which I anſwer, This I take to be as idle an inſinuation, as any one in his whole book; As if the clauſe, in that Law made in <hi>England</hi> were added, becauſe of <hi>G. K. Peter Boſs</hi> &amp;c. their being proſecuted here, a very ſilly groundleſs ſtory.</p>
            <p>In p. 88. he publiſheth a letter (or at leaſt part of one) in the name of <hi>G. F.</hi> relating to a book of <hi>Tho. Budd's.</hi> Now that letter I know not that ever I have ſeen, therefore, for divers reaſons before given, I ſhall not credit his quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, ſo much as to take any farther notice of it.</p>
            <p>In p. 90. he produceth a quotation, ſaid to be taken out of <hi>Richard. Hubberthorn</hi>'s. <hi>Works,</hi> wherein the ſaid <hi>R. H.</hi> blaming a Prieſt, ſaith, <q>Thou doſt allow of going to Law which the apoſtle did not &amp;c.</q> Now to what end ſhould he produce this againſt us? The moſt probable ſenſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:45026:35"/>
of <hi>Richard Hubberthorns</hi> words, being, to ſet the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle's doctrine over the Prieſt's head, in reproof of the common practice of rheir Church Members going to law with each others, allowed by the Prieſt, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe, who in the Apoſtle's ſenſe, might be termed unjuſt; the Apoſtle's drift, being to prevent Brother's going law with Brother, and to reprove therefore: A practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, which the <hi>Quakers</hi> allow no more of now, than they did in the beginning.</p>
            <p>I am now come to his <hi>Chapter</hi> 10th. entituled; <hi>Friends ſuffering, to be recorded by</hi> London <hi>Meeting;</hi> Which moſtly concerns thoſe of <hi>Weſt farſey</hi> ſide to ſpeak to, which they may do, if they ſee any need for it, and if they do, it may be added in a Poſtſcript, where alſo I intend to publiſh <hi>John Wood's</hi> vindication of himſelf from the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſions caſt upon him in this chapter, teſtefied both by himſelf and Neighbours. Only ſomething of what he ſaith about <hi>Ralph Ward,</hi> I ſhall take notice of in the next plaſe which take as follows. In his p. 92. 93 he hath it thus. <q>In the years 1694 and 95 <hi>Ralph Ward,</hi> a poor friend at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> was ſeveral times fined for conſcientiouſly refuſing to ſerve on Iuries, and had goods taken from him to the value of 4. L. 6 of which he complained to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour and Council, but had no releif. The Members of Counſel preſent were <hi>S. Carpenter, S.

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No it doth not, For though they eſteemed it as a remedy againſt corruption, yet it follows not from thence, that they eſteemed it good to be uſed. For, to make a law to maſſaere all the Iews, Papiſt, Maggletonians &amp;c. in the Kings dominions, who ſpread up and down their corrupt doctrines therein, would be of as tendincy to remedy that corruxtion; yet it would not be good to be uſed<hi>:</hi> To hang men for telling lyes againſt their honeſt Neighbours, or others would (doubtleſs) remedy that corruption, as much
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:45026:36"/>
as wearing would he a remedy giving againſt in falſe eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce; yet that would not he good to be uſed, and indeed I know not whatis better to be uſed, to prevent falſe ſpeaking, than to keep cloſe to him who is the truth it ſelf, and who hath commanded us not to ſwear at all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>D: L:</hi> proceeds in his p<hi>:</hi> 98 asking <q>Was not <hi>W: P:</hi> dotiſh when he brought this inſtance to prove the light in ſufficient &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Why Dotiſh? Doth it not prove clearly enough, that the light ſhewed them, that to falſifie their words was corruption? Why not ſufficient then, to ſhew them, that unleſs they kept to their words without any oath what<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſoewer, it was corruption alſo?</p>
            <p>He queries farther thus, viz, <q>Was it likely that the light or law in the beſt <hi>Gentiles</hi> would forbid all ſwearing at the ſame time when the law (outward) was in force, that allowed and commanded ſwearing?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Why not? For the outward law, under that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, allowed of hating enemies Matt. 5. 43. and of wars and fightings; but it is evident, ſome of the beſt <hi>Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> at the ſame time did not; but were taught more evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal precepts, to wit of loving enemies, and ceaſing from wars and fightings; of which I ſhall give one or two inſtances,, cited in <hi>G.

Then next as to loving enemies, which the law allowed to hate ſee p. 133. how <hi>Lycurgus</hi> that famous <hi>Spartan Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator,</hi> who, for making wholſom laws to reduce his people to good manners was hated and ſtoned, and among many other inſolencies ſuſtained, had one of his eyes ſmote out, with acudgel, by a certain young man called <hi>Alexander,</hi> for which he being appreherded, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to dye, <hi>Lycurgus</hi> redeemed him, took him as a friend into his own houſe, and there taught him to live well, ſo that it's ſaid he became a good man.</q> Much more might be mentioned, which though the outward law, under the legal diſpenſation, allowed and commanded oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Seed his own body, even as pleaſeth Him, and the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not carefull then about ſuch fooliſh queſtions and doubts, as to inquire about what manner of body God wil give them; but leave it to the Lord, in full Faith, that he will raiſe them up according to the Scriptures.</q> Thus far <hi>S. C.</hi> And now laſtly, what Authors ſhall I bring, to convince theſe our new oppoſers, that we do not deny, but own the Reſurrection, according to the Scripture? Surely, none more fit, than their great, original Sect Maſter <hi>G. K,</hi> who in <hi>Preſbyterian and Independent viſible Churches</hi> &amp;c. not yet retracted, which was written but in the year 1689, p. 3. 4, in anſwer to <hi>Sam. Norton's</hi> charging us with deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Reſurrection of the dead, ſaith thus, viz, <q>That they deny the Reſurrection of the dead, this is alſo a moſt falſe charge, which they can never prove; but becauſe we deny their carnal conceptions of the Reſurrection, and hold us to ſcripure words, which is moſt ſafe, there<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore they have ſo belyed us. And for the more ſatisfaction of the Reader (ſaith he) I refer him to a little book, called <hi>Truth's Principles</hi> publiſhed by ſome noted men of the <hi>Quakers.</hi> In which book, it is expreſſly affirmed, That we, to wit, the <hi>Quakers,</hi> believe that the ſame bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which is laid down ſhall be raiſed up at the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the dead, as much as a natural body can be the ſame with a ſpiritual body, or an earthly body can be the ſame with a havenly body, according to the Scripure teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; <hi>It is ſown natural but raiſed ſpiritual: And the glory of the heavenly is one, and the glory of the earthly is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</hi>
               </q> And this may ſatisfy any ſober enquirer &amp;c. Thus far <hi>G. K.</hi> To all which I ſay though this was ſo lately cited by <hi>G: K,</hi> out of a former book of our Friends, and laid down by him, as one of our principles, which he courts might ſatisfy any that inquires in ſobriety; Yet, it ſeems, it will not ſatisfy him now, for which I fear the chief reaſon is, for that he himſelf is gone into Apoſtacy and bitter enmity.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> This is not ſo, for Governour <hi>Fletcher's</hi> power here, expired before any Aſſembly ſate, or was ſo much a cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen in the year 1695. Neither did he in 1694 preſs the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, to raiſe a fund, towards the ſecuring the Province from the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians:</hi> So that allowing his one years miſtake, as to time; yet his charge in the main is utterly falſe.

If he had not ſeen them, then may the Reader eaſily obſerve, at what a ſandom rare, he ventures to beſpatter us; as alſo it may be percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that as his proceedings therein could not he honeſt and ſincere, as he ſaies they were, ſo neither could they proceed from a motion heavenly, as in his preface he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to.</p>
            <p>But this miſcheif maker doth not end his envious lying here, for in the ſame page, ſpeaking of one <hi>Babit</hi> and his company's ſtealing a ſloop from <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> ſaith thus; <q>Upon notice of which the <hi>Quakers</hi> very ſpeedily got a company of men together, ſearcht the Town for arms, ſupplied them with gunns, ſwords, powder and lead and gave them a Commiſſion, and hired them for 100 L. to recover the ſloop from ſaid Privateers, which they did, and <hi>Sam.

            <p>Anſw.

But, as it is no ſin to work on that day; ſo it is no ſin to abſtain from work on that day: for if it had, ſurely, the Primitive <hi>Chriſtians</hi> would many times have ſinned, in meeting to gether on that Day. It is no ſin in it ſelf, for the free People of <hi>Weſt Jerſie,</hi> to Chuſe their Magiſtrates and Officers, on another Day; and in another manner, than by their Laws and Conſtitutions is appointed: Yet, inaſmuch as it is no ſin, to Chuſe them on that Day, and in that manner, and it being according to their Law, and the Peoples Rights and Priviledges, it ought to be kept (Let <hi>D.

That they, that want Infallibility, are not true Miniſters<hi>:</hi> Now, ſeveral of the Books he quotes I want, and this among the reſt: Therefore, whether this be fairly quoted or not, I know not; Yet I believe the thing to be true (viz) That where any Miniſter, is not <hi>Infallibly aſſured,</hi> that what he miniſters to the People, is <hi>from the movings,</hi> and <hi>gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the holy Spirit of God, ſo far</hi> he is not a true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter; <hi>If any man ſpeak,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>let him ſpeak as the Oracles of God</hi> 1: Pet: 4: 11: then to be ſure, it muſt be from the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> which is <hi>Infallible:</hi> And as God's <hi>Spirit</hi> is <hi>Infallible,</hi> ſo are it's <hi>teachings</hi> and <hi>guidings:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, that G<hi>: K:</hi> (as well as G: W: &amp;c:) hath wrote in defence of Infallibility is clear; for in his Book, Inti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Next in his page 131. he cites an Epiſtle of <hi>E.

            </p>
            <p>Anſwer. To keep Cloſe to the Lord, and to the meaſure of himſelf in our hearts according to <hi>E. B.</hi> is too good Counſe to be disputed againſt.

            <p>I happening to have one of the books he cites in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boveſaid page, viz <hi>G.

either, as this abuſive <hi>D: L:</hi> would render us.</p>
            <p>In p: 138: 139: he aſſerts this falshood, viz, <q>'Tis the faith or belief of all your preachers in general<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That when you preach or pray, 'tis not you, but Chriſt in you that prays: I prove this to be your belief by theſe two reaſons: Firſt, You do never in your meetings pray for pardon or forgivineſs of ſin (Not that I have heard in twenty years due attendance) for ſeeing 'tis Chriſt in you that prays, there is no need of it, he being without<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſin.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw:</hi> He may as well charge all thoſe holy men of old, who have prayed to God, and yet heave not in all their prayers asked pardon for ſin, with the ſame as he falſly charges us with here, viz, with believing, that it is Chriſt in us that prays: And in order to prove, that what he objects againſt us, was not the common practice of the primitive Church, I ſhall produce an example, which at this time occurs to my mind, as it is related <hi>Acts.</hi> 4. 24. to 31. where we find that the Church then aſſembled together, <hi>lift up theie voices with one accord in prayer</hi> to God; in which prayer there is not one word of confeſſion of, or begging pardon for ſin: And if <hi>D: L:</hi> be ſo blind, as that he can perceive no difference or diſtinction to be made, between Chriſt by his <hi>ſpirit helping our infirmitie's,</hi> in our prayers, which we ſay he doth, and without which we cannot pray <hi>as we ought</hi> ſee <hi>Rom:</hi> 8: 26: and ſaying, that 'tis Chriſt in us that prays, which we ſay not; we cannot help it: Then what, or how due his attendance hath been, for twenty years, I know not, but ſure I am, I have heard earneſt cryes and ſervent ſupplications put up to God in our publick meetings, for pardon and remiſſion of ſins, many times in leſs than ten years.</p>

            <p>He continues in his p. 139. to caſt many unjuſt reflections, upon us, in relation to theſe two heads, of <hi>not praying for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pardon of ſins,</hi> and <hi>not praying to Chriſt at all;</hi> which is partly anſwered already, but in order to the more full clearing the latter objection, I ſhall take notice of one paſſage more in the ſame page.

Therefore this is no infallible ſign of our being guilty of his charge, that we came not forth according to his propoſition. And then the other part of his ſign, relating to a ſuppoſition of our coming forth, is as evidently fallible; for we have got, not only a little, but a great deal of advantage againſt him, and that very ſimply too; not only without any falſity, but alſo without ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matters beyond what they will naturally bear, and yet he may ſee we do not come forth according to this propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and therefore both his ſigns are fallible, and not to be needed, unleſs it be from them to make an obſervation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how ſtrangely men are infatuated, who draw back from, and riſe up againſt the truth.</p>
